# OpenNIC-DropSite
A simple PHP Dropsite for Domain Parking, Link Gateways or Credential Pages




What is this?
[------------]

This set of website files is geared to be a drop site for OpenNIC and Blockchain websites. The goal is to allow a new user to propagate some content on the OpenNIC Namespace quickly and with as little of a footprint as needed.  

A few examples for use are: Domain Parking, Domain Selling, A Link Gateway to other sites, An online business card or credentials site for your email, bitcoin or alternate coin address's, Bitmessage or other communication platform. 

The idea is to make it easy for anyone to throw something up that is simple useful and follows the ideals of privacy and security.
